							<h2>Experience and Skills</h2>
							<p>During the summer after my freshman year, I interned at Lavner Education, based at New York University, as an Information Technology Intern. The following summer, I gained further experience interning at Webster Bank in IT Strategy and Governance. In addition to my internships, I also volunteered as a Python Coding Instructor at Waterbury Youth Services. These roles have significantly enhanced my technical skills and contributed to my professional development.</p>
